# Bit-Manipulation
Assortment of [programs](https://github.com/JasonNDao/Bit-Manipulation/blob/main/hw3.pdf) that involve bitwise operations (Computer Architecture Fall 2020)

# Note:
If on Windows, before cloning, run `git config --global core.autocrlf input` on git.
The program was created to run on Unix based systems!
After finishing, to reset back to normal on Windows, run `git config --global core.autocrlf true` on git.

# To run:
Run `python2 autograder.py` in main directory folder.
