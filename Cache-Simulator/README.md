# Cache-Simulator
This [program](https://github.com/JasonNDao/Computer-Architecture/blob/main/Cache-Simulator/hw6.pdf) simulates cache read and writes

# Note:
If on Windows, before cloning, run `git config --global core.autocrlf input` on git.
The program was created to run on Unix based systems!
After finishing, to reset back to normal on Windows, run `git config --global core.autocrlf true` on git.

# To run:
Un-zip testcases.7z and then run `python2 autograder.py` in main directory folder.
